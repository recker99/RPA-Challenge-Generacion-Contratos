## Composition Patterns for AI Workflow Generation

O365 activities use **composition argument objects** to select files, calendars, mail folders, mailboxes, and SharePoint lists. Each argument has an `InputMode`/`ItemSelectionMode` enum that determines which sub-properties are required. Understanding these patterns is essential for generating valid XAML.

### Item Selection Pattern

See the [components reference](activities/components/) for full details on each argument type.

| Argument Type | Available Modes | Details |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| [`DriveItemArgument`](activities/components/DriveItemArgument.md) | Browse, ItemId, UseExisting, ItemUrl, FullPath, RelativePath | File/folder selection |
| [`CalendarArgument`](activities/components/CalendarArgument.md) | Browse, UseExisting | Calendar selection |
| [`MailFolderArgument`](activities/components/MailFolderArgument.md) | Browse, EnterPath | Outlook folder selection |
| [`MailboxArgument`](activities/components/MailboxArgument.md) | UseSharedMailbox | Shared mailbox selection |
| [`ListArgument`](activities/components/ListArgument.md) | Browse, Manually | SharePoint list selection |

### Model Types Quick Reference

Activities return these model types as `OutArgument<T>`. See the [types reference](activities/types/) for full property lists.

### Filter Pattern
